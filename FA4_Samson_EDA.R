# The plot is hollow up because the correlation between the mortality index and mean average temperature follows a U-shaped pattern. 
# The mortality index initially decreases as the mean average temperature increases but then risesÂ again. This implies a non-linear relationship in which the mortality index is affected by the mean average temperature in a not monotonic manner. 
# This U-shaped pattern suggests that particular temperature ranges may be associated with lower mortality rates, whereas others may be associated with higher mortality rates.

# The loess smoother's adaptability enables it to more accurately capture the fundamental structure of the data, resulting in residuals with fewer systematic patterns and a better reflection of the dataset's actual variability. 
# As a result, the loess smoother is frequently regarded as more faithful to the data because of its ability to provide a deeper representation of the underlying relationships.
